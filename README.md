# Coveo DevOps Challenge

## The challenge

One of your colleagues has started a project to analyze the files from an S3 bucket, output some information about them,
and calculate the cost of the storage. The project is not finished and he had to leave for personal reasons.
Your manager is asking you to finish the project and make it production-ready.

## Specifications

The tool is a shell command line utility that returns information over all [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) buckets in an Amazon account.

- The tool must work on Linux, OSX and Windows.
- It must be easy to install and use.
- Ideally, the tool won't require installation of any other tools / libraries / frameworks to work.
- Time is money, we cannot afford running a tool that takes hours to complete, your solution should return results within seconds (or minutes if you are willing to test our patience :-).

### The tool must return the following information

For each bucket:
- Name
- Creation date
- Number of files
- Total size of files
- Last modified date of the most recent file
- And the most important of all, **how much does it cost**

Your colleague has started the task and was well on his way to achieve the above with the code you will find in this branch.
**Although the code already runs, there are some TODO's left in the code for you to complete.**

## To prepare for your interview:

- Make sure you can run the code and understand what's going on in the code.
- Review the code and take notes on stuff you would improve or change. Assume this code is about to be in production
and that you have to plan the next few releases. Having an agile process in mind, what would you change in the first release, second
release, etc. This will help us focus our discussion on what's important first.
- Make sure you have addressed all the TODO's that were left in the code.
- Make sure to have a setup that allows you to hit a breakpoint and debug in a step-by-step manner. It doesn't matter which
application you use to do it, but make sure you're comfortable debugging in the environment you choose before the interview,
because bugs there will be ðŸ˜‰.
- Have an editor or IDE ready to code during the interview.
- Have Git installed.

Your colleague who started this didn't follow our normal standards, so you should have something to say about that code.
If you want to go the extra mile, you can improve on his work ahead of the interview, but being able to comment on what
you think is wrong and why you think it could be improved is more important than actually fixing any of it.
We are not looking for a perfect solution, we are more interested in your thought process and how you would approach
the problem.

We expect you to understand the whole project a minimum and have an opinion on it. We understand that you may not be 100%
familiar with AWS. It's normal and we don't expect you to learn everything before the interview.

## Running it

1. First you'll need to create an AWS account. One can be created for free.
2. Create an S3 bucket and upload some files into it. Bear in mind that there can be a charge if you go over the
[free tier requirements](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all&all-free-tier.q=S3&all-free-tier.q_operator=AND)
(5 GiB at time of writing).
3. To run the project itself, you'll need Python 3.8 or more recent and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
4. Run `poetry install`
5. Run `poetry run python ./main.py`

## During the technical interview

Be prepared for a peer review during your technical interview. Also expect some additional challenges as we may ask you
to run your program in a different environment with a significant number of files.

## Final advice

Make sure you have fun while performing this challenge. It is very rare that candidates grasp the extent of the pitfalls to
avoid and all the technical challenges involved. We are not looking for perfection, but you will be evaluated on your ability
to adapt when we face the various problems that you will inevitably be confronted.

During the interview, treat the interviewers as colleagues. Feel free to ask for help as you would normally do in the course
of your job. They are there to help you, not to trick you. Their main objective is to find in you their future colleague with
whom they will enjoy working.

See you soon.
